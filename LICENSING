Roboject is distributed using a dual license:
- an Open Source lciense (GPL v3) for open source projects
- a commercial license for commercial projects

* Open Source License
Roboject is available for free under the GPLv3 for open source projects, which may require the release of your code.

akquinet is an avid supporter of open source software. Our open source license is the appropriate option if you are creating an open source application under a license compatible with the GNU GPL license v3. Although the GPLv3 has many terms, the most important is that you must provide the source code of your application to your users so they can be free to modify your application for their own needs.

* Commercial Software License
This is the appropriate option if you want to use Roboject to develop commercial applications whose source code you want to keep proprietary. Please contact akquinet (http://www.akquinet.de/en) for further information about the license and support.

* Commercial OEM License
This is the appropriate option if you want to use Roboject to create your own commercially licensed SDK, or Android application builder. Since use cases vary widely, Commercial OEM licenses are customized for each customer. So please contact akquinet (http://www.akquinet.de/en) for more information.
